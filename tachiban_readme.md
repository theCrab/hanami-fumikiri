# Tachiban

Tachiban provides simple password hashing for user authentication with bcrypt.
The module provides methods for generating password hash and salt, password reset sent time and
a token in a form of random URL-safe base64 string to use for password reset links. It also provides
a method for user authentication.

The Tachiban code was extracted from a Hanami based web app using Hanami::Model and was also used in a Camping based web app using Active Record.

Though derived from a Hanami web app, Tachiban is currently not bound to Hanami.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tachiban'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tachiban

And include it in you application:

```ruby
include Tachiban
```


## Usage
Tachiban supports saving a user's `password_hash` and `salt` in the database. Password itself is
never stored in the database. To authenticate a user, the user has to be found in the database first and then the
`authenticated?` method compares the user's `password_hash` from the database with the
`password_hash` that is generated at the time of the authentication. For that the password from the
input and user's salt from the database is used.


#### Example:
__model__: User

__attributes__: name, surname, email, password_hash, password_salt,
                password_confirmation, password_reset_token, password_reset_sent_at

##### Methods:


To generate password salt

```ruby
generate_pass_salt
```

To generate password hash

```ruby
generate_pass_hash(password, salt)
```

To authenticate the user

```ruby
authenticated?(user_pass_hash, user_salt, input_pass)
```

To set the password reset sent time

```ruby
password_reset_sent_at
```

To generate a random url token
```ruby
token
```
